### **Summary of Lecture 1 - An Overview of Ethics**

#### **1. Difference Between Morals, Ethics, and Laws**  
- **Morals**: Personal beliefs about right and wrong.  
- **Ethics**: Standards of behavior expected by a group (e.g., society, profession).  
- **Laws**: Enforceable rules set by institutions.  

#### **2. Four Common Ethical Approaches**  
1. **Virtue Ethics**: Focuses on moral character (e.g., honesty, courage).  
   - *Challenge*: Lacks actionable guidance; virtues depend on context.  
2. **Utilitarian Approach**: Maximizes overall benefits over harms.  
   - *Challenge*: Difficult to measure and predict outcomes.  
3. **Fairness Approach**: Treats everyone equally unless relevant differences exist.  
   - *Challenge*: Subjective bias may influence decisions.  
4. **Common Good Approach**: Advances collective well-being (e.g., education, healthcare).  
   - *Challenge*: Hard to achieve consensus; "free-rider" problem.  

#### **3. Other Ethical Approaches**  
- **Duty/Rights Approach** (Kant, Locke): Emphasizes rationality, human dignity, and universal rights.  

#### **4. Corporate Ethics Programs**  
- **Key Components**:  
  - **Code of Ethics**: Guides behavior, identifies risks, and ensures compliance.  
  - **Ethics Officer**: Senior leader fostering ethical culture and compliance.  
  - **Social Audits**: Review ethical/social goals and share progress.  
  - **Ethics Training**: Encourages reporting misconduct without retaliation.  
  - **Employee Appraisals**: Include ethical criteria (e.g., fairness, accountability).  

#### **5. Ethical Decision-Making Process**  
1. **Develop a Problem Statement**: Clear, specific description of the issue.  
2. **Identify Alternatives**: Involve stakeholders and brainstorm options.  
3. **Evaluate Alternatives**: Weigh laws, ethics, and impacts on stakeholders.  
4. **Implement & Monitor**: Execute the solution and assess outcomes.  

#### **6. Case Study: Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)**
